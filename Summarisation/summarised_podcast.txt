my hope is that you will enjoy this as much as I have enjoyed retelling

This is the first installment of a Mahabharata podcast series. The goal is to retell the ancient Indian epic in an abridged, but not too abridged, audio format. The story is about the war between the cousins and the royal Krishna played in it. The hope is that listeners will enjoy the story as much as the narrator has enjoyed retelling it.
