      "Shiva walked back to the temple steps. As he sat down, he breathed in deeply and let the tranquil atmosphere suffuse him with its serenity. And then it happened. The moment that every unrealised heart craves for. The unforgettable instant that a soul, clinging on to the purest memory of its previous life, longs for. The moment which, in spite of a conspiracy of the gods, only a few lucky men experience. The moment when she enters his life.She rode in on a chariot, guiding the horses expertly into the courtyard, while a lady companion by her side held on to the railings. Although her black hair was tied in an understated bun, a few strands danced a spellbinding kathak in the wind. Her piercingly magnetic, blue eyes and bronzed skin were an invitation for jealousy from the goddesses. Her body, though covered demurely in a long angvastram, still ignited Shiva's imagination into sensing the lovely curves which lay beneath. Her flawless face was a picture of concentration as she manoeuvred the chariot skilfully into its parking place. She dismounted the chariot with an air of confidence.\n",

      "She walked over to Shiva and introduced herself. He was instantly mesmerized by her beauty and her presence. They began talking and soon realized that they had a lot in common. As they talked, Shiva felt himself falling deeper and deeper under her spell. He knew that he was in danger of losing himself completely, but he couldn't help it. The more he got to know her, the more he wanted to be with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, without warning, she leaned in and kissed him. It was a long, slow kiss, full of passion and promise. Shiva felt himself being pulled into a whirlpool of emotion and desire. He knew that he was in over his head, but he didn't care. He wanted this woman, and he was going to have her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next few weeks were a blur of passion and intensity. Shiva had never felt like this before, and he was consumed by her. He forgot about his duties at the temple, and he stopped meditating and practicing his yoga. He spent all of his time with her, and he was happy to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, one day, she disappeared. Shiva searched for her everywhere, but she was gone. He was devastated. He had lost himself completely in her, and now she was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shiva was a changed man after that. He was no longer the serene and peaceful monk that he once was. He was angry and resentful, and he felt betrayed by the woman he loved. He became obsessed with finding her, and he would stop at nothing to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "He became a master of tracking and tracking people down. He learned how to fight and how to use weapons. He became a dangerous man, driven by a single purpose: to find the woman he loved and make her pay for what she had done to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, after years of searching, he finally found her. She was living a happy life with her husband and children. Shiva watched them from the shadows, and he waited for his moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, one day, he struck. He attacked her husband first, brutally murdering him. And then he went after her. She begged for mercy, but he showed her none. He killed her slowly and painfully, making her pay for her betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, when she was dead, he collapsed to the ground, weeping uncontrollably. He had finally found peace.\n"
